<div class="blockquot"><p>That we might see, eyes were given us; and a
tongue to tell accurately what we had got to see. It is the alpha and
omega of all intellect that man has. No poetry, hardly even that of Goethe,
is equal to the true image of reality&mdash;had one eyes to see
that.&mdash;<span class="smcap">T. Carlyle</span>, <i>Letters to Varnhagen
Von Ense</i>.</p></div>


<p><i>The one English thing that has touched the heart of the world is the
English garden. Proof of this we have in such noble gardens as the
English park at Munich, the garden of the Emperor of Austria at
Laxenberg, the Petit Trianon at Versailles, the parks formed of recent
years round Paris, and many lovely gardens in Europe and America. The
good sense of English writers and landscape gardeners refused to accept
as right or reasonable the architect's garden, a thing set out as bricks
and stones are, and the very trees of which were mutilated to meet his
views as to "design" or rather to prove his not being able to see the
simplest elements of design in landscape beauty or natural form. And
some way or other they destroyed nearly all signs of it throughout our
land.</i></p>

<p><i>In every country where gardens are made we see the idea of the
English garden gratefully accepted; and though there are as yet no
effective means of teaching the true art of landscape gardening, we see
many good results in Europe and America. No good means have ever been
devised for the teaching of this delightful English art. Here and there
a man of keen sympathy with Nature does good work, but often it is
carried out by men trained for a very different life, as engineers in
the great Paris parks, and in our own country by surveyors and others
whose training often wholly unfits them for the study of the elements of
beautiful landscape. Thus we do not often see good examples of
picturesque garden and park design, while bad work is common.
Everywhere&mdash;unhappily, even in England, the home of landscape
gardening&mdash;the too frequent presence of stupid work in landscape
gardening offers some excuse for the two reactionary books which have
lately appeared&mdash;books not worth notice for their own sake, as they
contribute nothing to our knowledge of the beautiful art of gardening or
garden design. But so many people suppose that artistic matters are mere
questions of windy argument, that I think it well to show by English
gardens and country seats of to-day that the many sweeping statements of
their authors may be disproved by reference to actual things, to be seen
by all who care for them. We live at a time when, through complexity of
thought and speech, artistic questions have got into a maze of
confusion. Even teachers by profession confuse themselves and their
unfortunate pupils with vague and hyper-refined talk about art and
"schools" and "styles," while all the time much worse work is done than
in days when simpler, clearer views were held. To prove this there is
the example of the great Master's work and the eternal laws of nature,
on the study of which all serious art must be for ever based. Beneath
all art there are laws, however subtle, that cannot be ignored without
error and waste; and in garden design there are lessons innumerable both
in wild and cultivated Nature which will guide us well if we seek to
understand them simply.</i></p>

<p><i>These books are made up in great part of quotations from old books on
gardening&mdash;many of them written by men who knew books better than
gardens. Where the authors touch the ground of actuality, they soon show
little acquaintance with the subject; and, indeed, they see no design at
all in landscape gardening and admit their ignorance of it. That men
should write on things of which they have thought little is unhappily of
frequent occurrence, but to find them openly avowing their ignorance of
the art they presume to criticise is new.</i></p>

<p><i>A word or two on the state of architecture itself may not be amiss.
From Gower Street to the new Law Courts our architecture does not seem
to be in a much better state than landscape gardening is, according to
the architects to whom we owe the "Formal Garden" and "Garden Craft"! It
is William Morris&mdash;whose "design" these authors may respect&mdash;who
calls London houses "mean and idiotic rabbit warrens:" so that there is
plenty to do for ambitious young architects to set their own house in
artistic order!</i></p>

<p><i>As regards "formal gardening," the state of some of the best old
houses in England&mdash;Longleat, Compton-Wynyates, Brympton, and many
others, where trees in formal lines, clipped or otherwise, are not seen
in connection with the architecture&mdash;is proof against the need of the
practice. As regards the best new houses, Clouds, so well built by Mr.
Philip Webb, is not any the worse for its picturesque surroundings,
which do not meet the architect's senseless craving for "order and
balance"; while Batsford, certainly one of the few really good new
houses in England, is not disfigured by the fashions in formality the
authors wish to see revived, and of which they give an absurd example in
a cut of Badminton. There is, in short, ample proof, furnished both by
the beautiful old houses of England and by those new ones that have any
claim to dignity, that the system they seek to revive could only bring
costly ugliness to our beautiful home-landscapes.</i></p>

it should be&mdash;between the house beautiful and the ground near it is
worthy of more thought than it has had in the past, and the best ways of
effecting that union artistically should interest men more and more as
our cities grow larger and our lovely English landscape shrinks<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span> back from them.
The views of old writers will help us little, for a wholly different state
of things has arisen in these mechanical days. My own view is that we
have never yet got from the garden, and, above all, the home landscape,
half the beauty which we may get by abolishing the needless formality
and geometry which disfigure so many gardens, both as regards plan and
flower planting. Formality is often essential in the plan of a flower
garden near a house&mdash;<i>never</i> as regards the arrangements of its
flowers or shrubs. To array these in lines or rings or patterns can only
be ugly wherever done!</p>

<p>That men have never yet generally enjoyed the beauty that good garden
design may give is clear from the fact that the painter is driven from
the garden! The artist dislikes the common garden with its formality and
bedding; he cannot help hating it! In a country<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span> place he will seek
anything but the garden, but may, perhaps, be found near a wild Rose
tossing over the pigsty. This dislike is natural and right, as from most
flower gardens the possibility of any beautiful result is shut out! Yet
the beautiful garden exists, and there are numbers of cottage gardens in
Surrey or Kent that are as "paintable" as any bit of pure landscape!</p>

<p>Why is the cottage garden often a picture, and the gentleman's garden
near, wholly shut out of the realm of art, a thing which an artist
cannot look at long? It is the absence of pretentious "plan" in the
cottage garden which lets the flowers tell their tale direct; the simple
walks going where they are wanted; flowers not set in patterns; the
walls and porch alive with flowers. Can the gentleman's garden then,
too, be a picture? Certainly; the greater the breadth and means the
better the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
picture should be. But never if our formal "decorative" style
of design is kept to. Reform must come by letting Nature take her just
place in the garden.</p>

<p>After we have settled the essential approaches, levels, and enclosures
for shelter, privacy, or dividing lines around a house, the natural form
or lines of the earth herself are in nearly all cases the best to
follow, and in my work I face any labour to get the ground back into its
natural level or fall where disfigured by ugly banks, lines, or angles.</p>

<p>In the true Italian garden on the hills we have to alter the natural
line of the earth or "terrace" it, because we cannot otherwise cultivate
the ground or move at ease upon it. Such steep ground exists in many
countries, and where it does, a like plan must be followed. The strictly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
formal in such ground is as right in its way as the lawn in a garden in
the Thames valley. But the lawn is the heart of the true English garden,
and as essential as the terrace is to the gardens on the steep hills.
English lawns have too often been destroyed that "geometrical" gardens
may be made where they are not only needless, but harmful both to the
garden and home landscape. Sometimes on level ground the terrace walls
cut off the view of the landscape from the house, and, on the other
hand, the house from the landscape!</p>

<p>I hold that it is possible to get every charm of a garden and every
use of a country-seat without sacrifice of the picturesque or beautiful;
that there is no reason why, either in the working or design of gardens,
there should be a single false line in them. By this I mean hard and
ugly lines such as the earth never follows, as say, to mention a place
known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
to many, the banks about the head of the lake in the Bois de Boulogne.
These lines are seen in all bad landscape work, though with good workmen
I find it is as easy to form true and artistic lines as false and ugly
ones. Every landscape painter or observer of landscape will know what is
meant here, though I fear it is far beyond the limits of the ideas of
design held by the authors of the <i>Formal Garden</i>. Also, that every
charm of the flower garden may be secured by avoiding wholly the knots
and scrolls which make all the plants and flowers of a garden, all its
joy and life, subordinate to the wretched conventional design in which
they are "set out." The true way is the opposite. We should see the
flowers and feel the beauty of plant forms, with only the simplest
possible plans to ensure good working, to secure every scrap of turf
wanted for play or lawn, and for every enjoyment of a garden.</p>

<p>Such views I have urged, and carry them out when I can, in the hope of
bringing gardening into a line with art, from which it is now so often
divorced. It is natural that these views should meet with some
opposition, and the consideration of the <i>Formal Garden</i> gives the
opportunity of examining their value.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The question, briefly stated, is this: Are we,
in laying out our gardens, to ignore the house, and to reproduce
uncultivated Nature to the best of our ability in the garden? Or are we
to treat the house and garden as inseparable factors in one homogeneous
whole, which are to co-operate for one premeditated result?</p></div>

<p>No sane person has ever proposed to ignore the house. So far from
ignoring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
the house in my own work, where there is a beautiful house it tells me
what to do! Unhappily, the house is often so bad that nothing can
prevent its evil effect on the garden. "<i>Reproducing uncultivated
Nature</i>" is no part of good gardening, as the whole reason of a flower
garden is that it is a home for cultivated Nature. It is the special
charm of the garden that we may have beautiful natural objects in their
living beauty in it, but we cannot do this without care and culture to
begin with! Whether it be Atlas Cedar or Eastern Cypress, Lily-tree or
American Mountain Laurel, all must be cared for at first, and we must
know their ways of life and growth if we are to treat them so that they
will both grow well and be rightly placed&mdash;an essential point. And
the more precious and rare they are the better the place they should
have in the flower garden proper or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10"
id="Page_10">10</a></span> pleasure ground,&mdash;places always the object
of a certain essential amount of care even under the simplest and wisest
plans. If we wish to encourage "uncultivated Nature" it must surely be a
little further afield! A wretched flowerless pinched bedding plant and a
great yellow climbing Tea Rose are both cultivated things, but what a
vast difference in their beauty! There are many kinds of "cultivated
Nature," and every degree of ugliness among them.</p>

gradually to become less and less formal till it melted away into the

should be avowedly separated from the adjacent country by a clean
boundary line, a good high wall for choice. (<i>The Formal
Garden.</i>)</p></div>

<p>Would any one put this high wall in front of Gilbert White's house at
Selborne, or of Golder's Hill at Hampstead, or many English houses where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
the erection of a high wall would cut off the landscape? Not a word
about the vast variety of such situations, each of which would require
to be treated in a way quite different from the rest! There are many
places in every county that would be robbed of their best charms by
separating the garden from the adjacent country by a "good high wall."</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The custom of planting avenues and cutting
straight lines through the woods surrounding the house to radiate in all

garden wall, but in return gave Nature an absolutely free hand outside
it. (<i>The Formal Garden.</i>)</p></div>

than Claude's. At least I never saw any painted landscape like them&mdash;say

lawns in "broad expanse" if we build a high wall near the house to cut
off even the possibility of a lawn? This has been done in too many cases
to the ruin of all good effect and repose, often to shut out as good
landscapes as ever were painted! There are flagrant cases in point to be
found in private gardens in the suburbs of London. There is much bad and
ignorant landscape work as there is bad building everywhere, but errors
in that way are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>

<p>The place of formal gardening is clear for ever. The architect can help
the gardener much by building a beautiful house! That is his work. The
true architect, it seems to me, would seek to go no farther. The better
the real work of the architect is done, the better for the garden and
landscape. If there are any difficulties of level about the house
beautiful, they should be dealt with by the architect, and the better
his work and the necessary terracing, if any, are done, the pleasanter
the work of the landscape or other gardener who has to follow him should
be.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span></p>

<p>That a garden is made for plants is what most people who care for
gardens suppose. If a garden has any use, it is to treasure for us
beautiful flowers, shrubs, and trees. In these days&mdash;when our ways of
building are the laughing-stock of all who care for beautiful
buildings&mdash;there is plenty for the architect to do without spoiling our
gardens! Most of the houses built in our time are so bad, that even the
best gardening could hardly save them from contempt. Our garden flora is
now so large, that a life's work is almost necessary to know it. How is
a man to make gardens wisely if he does not know what has to be grown in
them? I do not mean that we are to exclude other men than the landscape
gardener proper from the garden. We want all the help we can get from
those whose tastes and training enable them to help us&mdash;the landscape
painter best of all, if he cares for gardens<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span> and trees&mdash;the country
gentleman, or any keen student and lover of Nature. The landscape
gardener of the present day is not always what we admire, his work often
looking more like that of an engineer. His gardening near the house is
usually a repetition of the decorative work of the house, of which I
hope many artistic people are already tired. And as I think people will
eventually see the evil and the wastefulness of this "decorative" stuff,
and spend their money on really beautiful and artistic things, so I
think the same often-repeated "knots" and frivolous patterns must leave
the artistic garden, and simpler and dignified forms take their place.</p>

<p>To endeavour to apply any one preconceived plan or general idea to
every site is folly, and the source of many blunders. The authors are
not blind to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
absurdities of the architectural gardeners, and say, on page 232:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Rows of statues were introduced from the French,
costly architecture superseded the simple terrace, intricate parterres
were laid out from gardeners' pattern books, and meanwhile the flowers
were forgotten. It was well that all this pomp should be swept away. We
do not want this extravagant statuary, these absurdities in clipped
work, this aggressive prodigality. But though one would admit that in
its decay the formal garden became unmanageable and absurd, the abuse is
no argument against the use.</p></div>

<p>Certainly not where the place calls for it, and all absolutely
necessary stone-work about a house should be controlled by the
architect; beyond that, nothing. To let him lay out our home landscapes
again with lines of trees, as shown in the old Dutch books, and with no
regard to landscape design and to the relations of the garden to the
surrounding country, would be the greatest evil that could come to the
beautiful home landscapes of Britain.</p>

<p>Not one word of the swift worker, Time! Its effect on gardens is one
of the first considerations. Fortress-town, castle, and moat all without
further use! In old days gardens had to be set within the walls; hence,
formal in outline, though often charming inside. To keep all that
remains of such should be our first care; never to imitate them now!
Many old gardens of this sort that remain to us are far more beautiful
than the modern formal gardening, which by a strange perversity has been
kept naked of plants or flower life! When safety came from civil war,
then came to us the often beautiful Eliza<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>bethan house, free of all moat
or trace of war. At one time it was rash to make a garden away from the
protecting walls. Now, any day in a country place beautiful situations
may be found for certain kinds of gardens far away from the house, out
of sight of it often.</p>

<p>Again, in the home fighting days there was less art away from the home.
Rugged wastes and hills; vast woodland districts near London; even small
houses moated to keep the cattle from wolves&mdash;fear of the rough hills
and woods! In those days an extension of the decorative work of the
house into the garden had some novelty to carry it off, while the kinds
of cultivated trees and shrubs were few. Hence if the old gardeners
wanted an evergreen line, hedge, or bush of a certain height, they
clipped an evergreen tree into the size they wanted. Notwithstanding
this we have no evi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22"
id="Page_22">22</a></span>dence that anything like the geometrical monotony
often seen in our own time existed then. To-day the ever-growing city,
pushing its hard face over the once beautiful land, should make us wish
more and more to keep such beauty of the earth as may be still possible
to us. The horror of railway embankments, where were once the beautiful
suburbs of London, cries to us to save all we can save of the natural
beauty of the earth.</p>

flower-garden to show the "modest foliage" of English trees when almost
every country house is surrounded by our native woods? According to such
childish views, the noble Cedars in the park at Goodwood and on the lawn
at Pain's Hill are out of place there! What is declared by Mr. Blomfield
to be absurd is the soul of true gardening&mdash;to show, on a small
scale it may be, some of the precious and inexhaustible loveliness of
vegetation on plain or wood or mountain. This is the necessary and
absolutely only true, just and fair use of a garden!</p>

<p>The very name of the book is a mistake. "Formal gardening" is rightly
applied only to the gardens in which both the design and planting were
formal and stupidly formal like the upper terrace of the Crystal Palace,
Kensington Gore, as laid out by Nesfield, Crewe Hall; and Shrubland, as
laid out by Barry, in which, as in others of these architects' gardens,
strict orders were given that no plants were to be allowed on the walls.
The architect was so proud of his design, that he did not want the
gardener at all, except to pound up bricks to take the place of flower
colour! It may be necessary to explain<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span> to some that this pounded brick
and tile in lieu of colours has frequently been laid down in
flower-gardens in our own day. To old gardens like Haddon and
Rockingham, in which the vegetation about the house is perfectly free
and natural in form, the term "formal gardening" is quite unfitted.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>But those who attack the old English formal
garden do not take the trouble to understand its very considerable
differences from the Continental gardens of the same period.</p></div>

<p>No one has "attacked" old English gardens. Part of my work has been
to preserve much record of their beauty. The necessary terraces round
houses like Haddon may be and are as beautiful as any garden ever made
by man. Can anything be more unlike than the delicate veil of beautiful
climbers and flowers over the grey walls of the courtyard at Ightham
Mote and the walls of some gardens of our own day? The great

<p>What, then, is the kind of "Formal Gardening" that is bad? It is the
purely formal or stone garden made for its own sake, often without a
shadow of excuse. The garden of the Crystal Palace in part; the stone
garden at the head of the Serpentine; Versailles; the Grand Trianon;
Caserta, Schönbrunn are among the public gardens of Europe where this
kind of garden is seen. Great harm has come to many a fair English lawn
through this system. Let us learn by one instance, easily seen, the harm
done in formal gardening, even where the ground called for an amount of
terracing not usual in the plains and mostly gentle<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span> lawns of England&mdash;I
mean the flower-garden at Shrubland Park, laid out by Sir Charles Barry,
of which I have recently altered the plan and which I planted with
graceful life where I found bare walls.</p>

<p>We will assume that the main terrace lines here are right, as the place
stands on a bluff, and speak of a secondary evil of this formal
gardening, which arose, I think, about the time Barry laid out
Shrubland. That was that the walls of the house or garden were <i>not</i>
to be graced by plants, and that to secure the keeping of the design,
coloured gravels were to take the place of flowers. This rule, as is
well known, has been carried out in many gardens&mdash;it was rigid
here. I see it in some of the new gardens, and in asking at Worth Park
why a long terra-cotta wall had not climbers on it, was told the
designer would not allow it!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29"
id="Page_29">29</a></span></p>

<p>Yet Nature clothes the rock walls with beautiful life, even to the snow
line, where the gems of the flower world stain the rocks with loveliest
flowers. The crag walls of every alpine valley are her gardens; the
Harebells toss their azure bells from the seams of the stones in the
bridges across the mountain streams; the ruins of the temples of the
great peoples of old, who really could build nobly, grow many a wild
flower. Even when we take the stone and build with it, tender colours of
lowly plants soon come and clothe the stone.</p>

<p>But the maker of these miserable garden walls, without use or need, says
in effect, <i>Here Nature shall not come to hide my cleverness. I have
built walls, and bare they must be!</i></p>

<p>Well, with this bareness of the wall there were the usual geometrical
pattern beds, many filled with sand and broken<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span> stone, and only very low
and formal beds of flowers pinched into very low carpets, with much Box
often edging beds a foot across. When I first went one spring day with
Mr. Saumarez, we saw a large showy bed, and on going near, found it
composed of pieces of broken brick painted yellow, blue, and red!</p>

<p>So, apart from needless formality of design and bare walls where no
walls were wanted, there was often an ugly formality of detail, a
senseless attempt to leave Nature out of the garden, an outrage against
all that ever has or ever can make a garden delightful throughout the
year by ruling that even the walls of the house should not shelter a
Rose! And that is only part of what we get by letting "builders and
decorators" waste precious means in stone that should be devoted to the
living treasures of garden, lawn, or wood.</p>

class="smcap">"Nature" and what we mean by it</span></h2>


<p>As to a natural school of landscape gardening, the authors say:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A great deal is said about Nature and her beauty,
and fidelity to Nature, and so on; but as the landscape gardener never
takes the trouble to state precisely what he means by Nature, and,
indeed, prefers to use the word in half a dozen different senses, we are
not very much the wiser so far as principles are concerned.</p></div>

<p>They make this statement as if all beautiful natural landscape were a
closed book; as if there were no stately Yews, in natural forms, on the
Merrow Downs, as well as clipped Yews at Elvaston; as if the
tree-fringed mountain lawns of Switzerland did not exist; or lovely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
evergreen glades on the Californian mountains, or wild Azalea gardens on
those of Carolina, or even naturally-grown Planes in London squares.</p>

<p>There are many gardens and parks which clearly show what is meant by
the "natural" style; and though, like others, this art is too often
imperfect, we have so many instances of its success, that it is curious
to find any one shutting his eyes to them. There are lessons in
picturesque gardening in every country in Europe and in many parts of
North America. Mr. Olmstead's work in America and Mr. Robert Marnock's
in England teach them; they may be learnt in many English gardens&mdash;from
Sir Richard Owen's little garden in Richmond Park to Dunkeld&mdash;even small
rectory and cottage gardens, wholly free of architectural aids, show the
principle. It was but a few weeks ago, in the garden of the English
Embassy in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
Paris, that I was struck with the simplicity of the lawn and
plan of the garden there, and its fitness for a house in a city.</p>

<p>To support their idea that there is and can be no natural school of
landscape gardening, the authors suppose what does not exist, and
describe</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A piece of ground laid out with a studied
avoidance of all order, all balance, all definite lines, and the result
a hopeless disagreement between the house and its surroundings. This
very effect can be seen in the efforts of the landscape gardener, and in
old country houses, such as Barrington Court, near Langport, where the
gardens have not been kept up.</p></div>

<p>Here, instead of taking one of the many good examples in Britain, they
take poor, beautiful old Barrington, now an ill-kept farmhouse, with
manure piled against the walls and the ceiling of the dining-room
propped up with a Fir pole! The foolish proposition here laid down,
that, because a garden is pictur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34"
id="Page_34">34</a></span>esque there must necessarily be a
"<i>studied avoidance of all order, all balance, all definite lines</i>,"
is disproved by hundreds of gardens in England. Why did not the authors
take Miss Alice de Rothschild's garden at Eythorpe, or any beautiful and
picturesque English garden, to compare with their results in stone and
clipped and aligned trees?</p>

<p>This, too, in the face of the facts of the case, of proof ready for the
authors, in gardens in every country, from Prospect Park at Brooklyn to
the English park at Munich. The fact that the Ph&oelig;nix Park at Dublin
is laid out in a fine, picturesque way does not forbid a great straight
road through it&mdash;a road finer than in any strait-laced park in France.
The late Robert Marnock was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36"
id="Page_36">36</a></span> best landscape gardener I have known,
and I never saw one of his many gardens where he did not make an ample
straight walk where an ample straight walk was required&mdash;as, indeed,
many may remember is the case in the Botanic Gardens in the Regent's
Park, laid out by him.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Again, Nature is said to prefer a curved line
to a straight, and it is thence inferred that all the lines in a garden,
and especially paths, should be curved.</p>

<p>The utter contempt for design of the landscape gardener is shown
most conspicuously in his treatment of paths. He lays them about at
random, and keeps them so narrow that they look like threads, and
there is barely room to walk abreast.</p></div>

<p>The opposite of this is indeed the truth, for many gardens and parks
laid out with some regard to landscape beauty are partly spoiled by the
size and number of the walks, as in the gardens around Paris&mdash;the Parc
Monceau and Buttes Chaumont, for instance. The slightest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
knowledge of gardens would show that walks like threads are no necessary
part of landscape gardening!</p>

<p>This error shows well the effect of men reading and writing about what
they have not seen.</p>

<p>The axiom on which landscape gardening rests is declared by Messrs.
Blomfield and Thomas to be</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Whatever Nature does is right; therefore let
us go and copy her (p. 5).</i></p></div>

<p>Here is a poor sneer at true art, not only at art in landscape
gardening, but in all the fine arts. The central and essential idea of
the landscape art is choice of what is beautiful&mdash;not taking the salt
waste in Utah, or a field of weeds, or a Welsh slope of decayed slate,
or the bog of Allen, or the thousand other things in Nature that are
monotonous or dull to us, even though here and there beautiful as a wide
bog may be. We can have in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38"
id="Page_38">38</a></span> garden a group of Scotch Firs as good in
form as a fine group in wild Nature, and so of the Cedar of Lebanon and
many of the lovely trees of the world. We can have bits of rock alive
with alpine flowers, or pieces of lawn fringed with trees in their
natural forms and as graceful as the alpine lawns on the Jura.</p>

<p>So of all other true art. The Venus of Milo is from a noble type of
woman&mdash;not a mean Greek. The horses of the Parthenon are the best
types of Eastern breed, full of life and beauty, not sickly beasts. Great
landscape painters like Corot, Turner, and Troyon show us in their work
the absurdity of this statement so impertinently used. They seek not
ugly things because they are natural, but beautiful combinations of
field, and hill, wood, water, tree, and flower, and grass, selecting
groupings which go to make good composition,<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span> and then waiting for the
most beautiful effects of morning, evening, or whatever light suits the
chosen subject best, so give us lovely pictures! But they work always
from faithful study of Nature and from stores of knowledge gathered from
Nature study, and that is the only true path for the landscape gardener;
as all true and great art can only be based on the eternal laws of
Nature.</p>

<p>All other gardens are, of course, impossible to the authors&mdash;the
Parc Monceau, the informal gardens about Paris, Glasnevin, the Botanic
Gardens in Regent's Park and at Sheffield, Golder's Hill, Greenlands,
Pendell Court, Rhianva, and the thousand cottage, rectory, and other
British gardens where no wall is seen! The Bamboo garden at Shrubland,
the Primrose garden at Munstead, the rock and other gardens,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
which we must keep in quiet places away from any sight of walls, are all
"<i>impossible</i>" to these authors! How much better it would be for every
art if it were impossible for men to write about things of which by
their own showing they have not even elementary knowledge!</p>

<p>And the sketches in the book show us what these possible gardens are!
They are careful architects' drawings, deficient in light and shade; not
engraved, but reproduced by a hard process, some being mere
reproductions of old engravings; and diagrams of old "knots" and
"patterns," with birds and ships perched on wooden trellises, without
the slightest reference to any human or modern use. A curious one of
Badminton will show fully the kind of plan the authors wish to see
revived. Some of the illustrations show the evils of the system which
the authors advo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42"

a very interesting and real old garden. Interesting as it is from age,
the ugliness of the clipped forms takes away from the beauty of the
house. Even in sketches of gardens like Montacute and Brympton, the
beauty of the gardens is not well shown. The most interesting drawings,
it is not surprising to find, are the informal ones! Many of the others
show the <i>evil</i>, not the good, of the system advocated, by their hard
lines and the emphasising of ugly forms.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Horticulture stands to garden design much as
building does to architecture. This book has been written entirely from
the standpoint of the designer, and therefore contains little or no
reference to the actual methods of horticulture.</p></div>


<p>Throughout the book it is modestly assumed that there can be no
"design" in anything but in lines of stone, and clipped trees to
"harmonise" with the stone, and to bring in "order" and "balance." A
Longleat, Highclere or Little Trianon, or any of the many English places
which are planted in picturesque ways can show no design; but a French
town, with its wretched lines of tortured Limes, is "pure" and "broad"
in design. <i>The naiveté</i> of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44"
id="Page_44">44</a></span> the book in this respect is often droll. One
amusing passage is on p. 54:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>However rich the details, there is no difficulty
in grasping the principle of <i>a garden laid out in an equal number of
rectangular plots</i>. Everything is straightforward and logical; you are
not bored with hopeless attempts to master the bearings of the
garden.</p></div>

<p>This is the kitchen gardener's view, and that of the market gardener of
all countries, but the fun is in calling the idea of it "<i>grasping a
principle</i>"! At this rate makers of chessboards have strong claims to
artistic merit!</p>

<p>No wonder that men who call a "principle" the common way of setting out
kitchen and cabbage gardens from Pekin to Mortlake can see no design in
the many things that go to make a beautiful landscape!</p>

<p>Equally stupid is the assumption, throughout the book, that the people
the authors are pleased to term "landscapists" flop their houses down in
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>

<p>The following glaring piece of injustice is due to want of the most
elementary consideration of garden design:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Grass-work as an artistic quantity can hardly
be said to exist in landscape gardening. It is there considered simply
as so much background to be broken up with shrubs and Pampas Grass and
irregular beds (p. 135).</p></div>

<p>The opposite of this is the fact. Grass-work as an "artistic
quantity" did not exist in anything like the same degree before
landscape gardening. One of the faults of the formal style of gardening
still seen in France and Austria is that there is little or no Grass.
Compare the Jardin des Plantes in Paris with the Parc<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span> Monceau, or the
many other gardens about Paris in which Grass is an "artistic quantity."
One of the most effective reasons indeed for adopting the English
landscape garden was that it gave people some fresh and open Grass,
often with picturesque surroundings, and, nowadays, one can hardly
travel on the continent and not see some pleasant results of this. In
England, the landscape gardeners and writers have almost destroyed every
trace of the stiff old formal gardens, and we cannot judge the ill
effects of the builder's garden so easily as in France. As a rule, the
want of rest and freshness in tropical and sub-tropical gardens is due
to the absence of those broad and airy breadths of greensward which, in
gardens at least, are largely due to landscape gardening. Think of
Warwick without its turf and glorious untrimmed Cedars!</p>

<p>Consider the difference between a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48"
id="Page_48">48</a></span> picturesque landscape like the
Emperor of Austria's stately garden at Laxenberg, near Vienna, and the
gardens in the same city formed of miserable clipped trees in lines!
Grass as an "artistic quantity" is finely visible at Laxenberg; in the
old clipped gardens gravel and distorted trees are the only things seen
in quantity&mdash;we cannot call it "artistic."</p>

<p>"Landscapist" is used throughout the book as a term of contempt. The
authors take some of the worst work that is possible, and condemn all in
the same opprobrious terms, as if we were to condemn the noble art of
the builders of the Parthenon on seeing a "jerry" building in London.
They may be quite sure that there <i>is</i> a true and beautiful art of
landscape gardening, notwithstanding their denunciations, and it is none
the less real because there is no smug definition of it that pleases the
minds of men who declare that it does not exist.<span class="pagenum"><a

painter, or, perhaps it would be fairer to say, as the builder and his
workmen stand to the architect.</p></div>

<p>What modesty!</p>

<p>The men whose business it is to design gardens are heartily abused. How
very graceful it would be on the part of one of them to write an essay
telling architects how to build, and showing that to build well it is
not necessary to know anything about the inhabitants or uses of a house!</p>

If this park had been planted out with groves and avenues of
Limes, like the boulevard at Avallon, or the squares at Vernon, or even
like the east side of Hyde Park between the Achilles statue and the

lines and squares of trees like those at Vernon, which I once saw half
bare of leaves long before the summer was over!</p>

<p>The authors see with regret that the good sense of planters has for
many years been gradually emancipated from the style (as old as the
Romans and older) of planting in rows. It was the very early and in a

<p>I believe we cut Grass when we want hay, or soft turf to play on, but
disfiguring a noble tree is not a necessary part<span class="pagenum"><a

our profit or pleasure. Perhaps, as is probable, Mr. Blomfield has never
noticed what a beautiful tree a Yew in its natural form is. It is not
only on the hills he may see them. If he will come and see them in my
own garden in a high wind some day, or when bronzed a little with a hard
winter, he may change his amusing notions about clipped Yews.</p>

<p>I think I can give Mr. Blomfield a rational explanation of why it is
foolish to clip so fair a tree or any <i>tree</i>.</p>

<p>I clip Yews when I want to make a hedge of them, but then I am
clipping a hedge, and not a tree. I hold up "the clipped Yew tree to
obloquy," as the tree in its natural form is the most beautiful
evergreen tree of our western world&mdash;as fine as the Cedar in its plumy
branches, and more beautiful than any Cedar in the colour of its stem.
In our own day we have seen trees of the same<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span> great order as the Yew
gathered from a thousand hills&mdash;from British Columbia, through North
America and Europe to the Atlas Mountains, and not one of them has yet
proved to be so beautiful as our native Yew when it is allowed to grow
unclipped root or branch. But in gardens the quest for the strange and
exotic is so constant, that few give a fair chance to the Yew as a tree,
while in graveyards where it is so often seen in a very old state, the
frequent destruction of the roots in grave-digging prevents the tree
from reaching its full stature and beauty, though there are Yews in
English churchyards that have lived through a thousand winters.</p>

branching. It is not my own idea only that I urge here, but that of all
who have ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
thought of form, foremost among whom we must place artists
who have the happiness of always drawing natural forms. Let Mr.
Blomfield stand near one of the Cedar-like Yews by the Pilgrim's Way on
the North Downs, and, comparing it with trees cut in the shape of an
extinguisher, consider what the difference means to the artist who seeks
beauty of form. Clipping such trees does not merely deserve "obloquy";
it is worse than idiotic, as there is a sad reason for the idiot's ways.</p>

<p>If I use what in the Surrey nurseries are called "hedging Yews" to form
a hedge, high or low, I must clip them to form my hedge, and go on doing
so if I wish to keep it, or the hedge would soon show me that it was
"subject to natural laws," and escape from the shears.</p>

<p>What right have we to deform things given us so perfect and lovely
in form? No cramming of Chinese feet into im<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>possible shoes is half so
wicked as the wilful distortion of the divinely beautiful forms of
trees. The cost of this hideous distortion alone is one reason against
it, as one may soon find out in places where miles of trees cut into
wall-like shape have to be clipped, as at Versailles and Schönbrunn!
This clipping is a mere survival of the day when gardens had very few
trees, and it was necessary to clip the few they had to fit certain
situations to conform to the architect's notion of "garden design." This
is not design at all from any landscape point of view; and though the
elements which go to form beautiful landscape, whether home landscape or
the often higher landscape beauty of the open country, are often subtle,
and though they are infinitely varied, they are none the less real. The
fact that men when we had few trees clipped them into walls and
grotesque shapes to make them serve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58"
id="Page_58">58</a></span> their notions of "design" is surely
not a reason why we, who have the trees of a thousand hills with trees
of almost every size and shape among them, should violate and mutilate
some of the finest natural forms!</p>

</div>

<p>Thus while it may be right to clip a tree to form a wall,
dividing-line, or hedge, it is never so to clip trees grown as single
specimens or groups, as by clipping such we only get ugly
forms&mdash;unnatural, too. Last autumn, in Hyde Park, I saw a man clipping
Hollies at the Rotten Row end of the Serpentine, and asking him why it
was done, he said it was to "keep them in shape," though, to do him
justice, he added that he thought it would be better to let them alone.
Men who clip so handsome a tree as the Holly when taking no part in a
hedge or formal line are blind to beauty of form. To tolerate such
clipped forms is to prove oneself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59"
id="Page_59">59</a></span> callous to natural beauty of tree
form, and to show that we cannot even see ugliness.</p>

<p>Take, again, the clipped Laurels by which many gardens and drives are
disfigured. Laurel in its natural shape in the woods of west country or
other places, where it is let alone, is often fine in form, though we
may have too much of it. But it is planted everywhere without thought of
its stature or fitness for the spot, and then it grows until the shears
are called in, and we see nearly every day its fine leaves and free
shoots cut short back into ugly banks and sharp, wall-like, or formless
masses, disfiguring many gardens without the slightest necessity. There
is no place in which it is used clipped for which we could not get
shrubs quite suitable that would not need mutilation. It is not only
clipped trees that are ugly, but even trees like the Irish Yew,
Welling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>tonia,
and some Arbor-vitæ, which frequently assume shapes like extinguishers
or the forms of clipped trees. It often happens that these, when
over-planted or planted near houses, so emphasise ugly forms about the
house, that there is no beauty possible in the home landscape. Many of
such ugly, formless trees have been planted within the last generation,
greatly to the injury of the garden landscape.</p>

<p>In the old gardens, where, from other motives, trees were clipped when
people had very few Evergreens or shrubs of any kind, or where they
wanted an object of a certain height, they had to clip. It is well to
preserve such gardens, but never to imitate them, as has been done in
various English and American gardens. If we want shelter, we can get it
in various delightful ways without clipping, and, while getting it, we
can enjoy the beautiful natural forms of the finest<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span> Evergreens. Hedges
and wall-like dividing lines of green living things will now and then be
useful, and even may be artistically used; they are sometimes, however,
used where a wall would be better, walls having the great advantage of
not robbing the ground near. A wall is easily made into a beautiful
garden with so many lovely things, too, from great scrambling yellow
Roses to alpine flowers. To any one with the slightest sympathy with
Nature or art these things need not be said.</p>

class="smcap">No Line in Nature!</span></h2>


<div class="blockquot"><p>Now as a matter of fact in Nature&mdash;that
is, in the visible phenomena of the earth's surface&mdash;there are no
lines at all; "a line" is simply an abstraction which conveniently
expresses the direction of a succession of objects which may be either
straight or curved. "Nature" has nothing to do with either straight
lines or curved; it is simply begging the question to lay it down as an
axiom that curved lines are more "natural" than straight.</p></div>

<p>Then men must never again talk of the "lines" of a ship! Perhaps Mr.
Blomfield would accept a plumb line? One can hardly leave London an hour
before a person who looks at the landscape may see the lines or
boundaries between one mass and another. Who could stand amongst downs
or an alpine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
valley and say there are no lines in them, inasmuch as one
of the most visible and delightful things in all such cases is the
beauty of those lines? This is the key of the whole question of
landscape gardening. There is no good landscape gardening possible
without a feeling for the natural gradation and forms of the earth.</p>

<span class="caption">Broadlands, Hants</span>
</div>

<p>It can be seen in little things, like the slope of a field as well as
in the slope of a mountain, and it is the neglect of this which leaves
us so little to boast of in landscape work. In a country slightly
diversified it is, of course, more important than in a perfectly flat
one, but in all diversified ground no good landscape work can be done
without regarding the natural gradation of the earth, which will often
tell us what to do. It is blindness to this principle which makes so
many people cut their roads and walks crudely through banks,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>leaving
straight sharp sides&mdash;false lines, in fact&mdash;when a little care and
observation would have avoided this and given a true and beautiful line
for a road or walk.</p>

<p>Once the necessary levels are settled and the garden walks by straight
walls about the house are got away from, we soon come to ground which,
whether we treat it rightly or not, will at once show whether the work
done be landscape work or not. No plan, it seems to me, is so good as
keeping to the natural form of the earth in all lawn, pleasure ground,
and plantation work. Roads, paths, fences, plantations, and anything
like wood will be all the better if we are guided by natural lines or
forms, taking advantage of every difference of level and every little
accident of the ground for our dividing lines and other beginnings or
endings.</p>

<p>In the absence of any guidance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65"
id="Page_65">65</a></span> this sort, what we see is brutal
cutting through banks, lines like railway embankments&mdash;without the
justification there is for the sharpness of a railway embankment&mdash;and
ugly banks to roads, very often ugly in their lines too. If we are ever
to have a school of true landscape gardening, the study and observation
of the true gradation of the earth must be its first task.</p>

<p>This gentleman, unfortunately without any knowledge of plants, trees,
or landscape beauty, launches out into the dreary sea of quotations from
old books about gardens, and knows so little of where he is going, that
he is put out of his course by every little drift of wind.</p>

<p>One goes through chapter after chapter thinking to get to the end of
the weary matter only to find again nothing but quotations, even to
going back to an old book for a song. When at last we come to a chapter
on <i>"Art in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67"
id="Page_67">67</a></span> Garden</i>," this is what is offered us as
sense on a charming subject, familiar to many, so that all may judge of
the depth of this foolish talk about it! Such a writer discussing in
this way a metaphysical or obscure subject might swim on in his inky
water for ever, and no one know where he was!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Let us here point to the fact, that any garden
whatsoever is but Nature idealised, pastoral scenery rendered in a
fanciful manner. It matters not what the date, size, or style of the
garden, it represents an idealisation of Nature. <i>Real</i> nature exists
outside the artist and apart from him. The Ideal is that which the
artist conceives to be an interpretation of the outside objects, or that
which he adds to the objects. The garden gives imaginative form to
emotions the natural objects have awakened in man. The <i>raison d'être</i>
of a garden is man's feeling the <i>ensemble</i>.</p></div>

<p>But we cannot allow him to bring the false and confusing "art" drivel of
the day into the garden without showing the absurdity of his ideas.</p>

<p>The illustrations are of the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68"
id="Page_68">68</a></span> wretched kind produced by some process, the only
interesting one being one of Levens. The most childish ideas of the
garden prevail&mdash;indeed we hardly like to call them childish,
because children do put sensible questions and see clearly. For
instance, for the author there is no art in gardening at all&mdash;the
"art" consists entirely of building walls and planting Yew hedges. Thus
the work of the late James Backhouse, who knew every flower on the hills
of Northern England, and expressed that knowledge in his charming rock
garden, is not art, but cutting a tree into the shape of a cocked hat
<i>is</i> art, according to Mr. Sedding!</p>

<a name="Drummond_Castle" id="Drummond_Castle"></a>

Scotland, in position requiring terracing</span>
</div>

<p>He assumes that landscape gardeners all follow artistic ways, and
that only architects make terraces; whereas the greatest sinners in this
respect have been landscape gardeners&mdash;Nesfield and Paxton. He has
paid so little attention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69"
id="Page_69">69</a></span> to the subject, that he says that the landscape
gardener's only notion is to put Grass all around the house! It does not
even occur to him that there may be Grass on one side of a house and
gardens of various sorts at the others, as at Goodwood, Shrubland,
Knole, and that a house may have at each side a different expression of
landscape gardening!</p>

<p>He takes the <i>English Flower Garden</i> as the expression of landscape
gardening practice; whereas the book, in all the parts that treat of
design, is a protest against the formation by landscape gardeners of
costly things which have nothing to do with gardening and nothing to do
with true architecture. The good architect is satisfied with building a
beautiful house, and that we are all the happier for. But what we have
to deplore is that men who are not really architects, who are not
gardeners,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
should cover the earth with rubbish like the Crystal Palace
basins, the thing at the top of the Serpentine, and the Grand Trianon at
Versailles.</p>

<p>Here is a specimen of Mr. Sedding's knowledge of the landscape art.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>For the "landscape style" does not countenance
a straight line, or terrace, or architectural form, or symmetrical beds
about the house, for to allow these would not be to photograph Nature.
As carried into practice, the style demands that the house shall rise
abruptly from the Grass, and the general surface of the ground shall be
<i>characterised by smoothness and bareness (like Nature!)</i>.</p></div>

title="Madresfield" />
<span class="caption">Madresfield. Example of modern English garden</span>
</div>

<p>If he had even taken the trouble to see a good garden laid out by Mr.
Marnock or anybody worthy of the name of landscape gardener, he would
find that they knew the use of the terrace very well. If he had taken
the trouble to see one of my own gardens, he would find beds quite as
formal, but not so frivolous as those described in the older books, and
lines simple and straight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71"
id="Page_71">71</a></span> as they can be. Where Barry left room for a
dozen flowers at Shrubland I put one hundred; so much for the
"<i>bareness</i>"!</p>


<p>On page 180 he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I have no more scruple in using the scissors
upon tree or shrub, where trimness is desirable, than I have in mowing
the turf of the lawn that once represented a virgin world. There is a
quaint charm in the results of the topiary art, in the prim imagery of
evergreens, that all ages have felt. And I would even introduce
Bizarreries on the principle of not leaving all that is wild and odd to
Nature outside of the garden paling; and in the formal part of the
garden <i>my Yews should take the shape of pyramids, or peacocks, or
cocked hats, or ramping lions in Lincoln green, or any other conceit I
had a mind to, which vegetable sculpture can take</i>.</p></div>

<p>After reading this I saw again some of the true "vegetable sculpture"
that I have been fortunate to see; Reed and Lily, a model for ever in
stem, leaf, and bloom; the grey Willows of Britain, sometimes lovelier
than Olives against our skies; many-columned Oak groves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>set in
seas of Primroses, Cuckoo flowers and Violets; Silver Birch woods of
Northern Europe beyond all grace possible in stone; the eternal garland
of beauty that one kind of Palm waves for hundreds of miles throughout
the land of Egypt,&mdash;a vein of summer in a lifeless world: the noble
Pine woods of California and Oregon, like fleets of colossal masts on
mountain waves&mdash;saw again these and many other lovely forms in
garden and woodland, and then wondered that any one could be so blind to
the beauty of plant and tree as to write as Mr. Sedding does here.</p>

<p>From the days of the Greeks to our own time, the delight of all great
artists has been to get as near this divine beauty as the material they
work with permits. But this deplorable "<i>vegetable sculptor's</i>"
delight is in distorting beautiful natural forms; and this in the one
art in which we enjoy the living things them<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>selves, and not merely
representations of them!</p>

<p>The old people from whom he takes his ideas were not nearly so foolish,
as when the Yew tree was used as a shelter or a dividing line, and when
a Yew was put at a garden door for shelter or to form a hedge, it was
necessary to clip it if it was not to get out of all bounds. But here is
a man delighting for its own sake in what he calls with such delicate
feeling "<i>vegetable sculpture</i>," in "cocked hats" and "ramping
lions"!</p>

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
